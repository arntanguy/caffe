\section*{Welcome to Caffe}

Caffe is a framework for convolutional neural network algorithms, developed with speed in mind. It was created by \href{http://daggerfs.com}{\tt Yangqing Jia}, and is in active development by the \href{http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu}{\tt Berkeley Vision and Learning Center}.

Caffe is released under \href{https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/LICENSE}{\tt the B\+S\+D 2-\/\+Clause license}.

\subsection*{Why Caffe?}

Caffe aims to provide computer vision scientists and practitioners with a {\bfseries clean and modifiable implementation} of state-\/of-\/the-\/art deep learning algorithms. For example, network structure is easily specified in separate config files, with no mess of hard-\/coded parameters in the code.

At the same time, Caffe fits industry needs, with blazing fast C++/\+C\+U\+D\+A code for G\+P\+U computation. Caffe is currently the fastest G\+P\+U C\+N\+N implementation publicly available, and is able to process more than {\bfseries 40 million images per day} with a single N\+V\+I\+D\+I\+A K40 or Titan G\+P\+U (or 20 million images per day on a K20 G\+P\+U)$\ast$. That's 192 images per second during training and 500 images per second during test.

Caffe also provides {\bfseries seamless switching between C\+P\+U and G\+P\+U}, which allows one to train models with fast G\+P\+Us and then deploy them on non-\/\+G\+P\+U clusters with one line of code\+: {\ttfamily Caffe\+::set\+\_\+mode(\+Caffe\+::\+C\+P\+U)}. Even in C\+P\+U mode, computing predictions on an image takes only 20 ms when images are processed in batch mode. While in G\+P\+U mode, computing predictions on an image takes only 2 ms when images are processed in batch mode.
